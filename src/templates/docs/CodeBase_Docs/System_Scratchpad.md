## Lint Check Results (2025-03-15)

### Critical Issues
1. Cognitive complexity in report.py (execute method) - 20 vs allowed 15
2. Cognitive complexity in report.py (_add_structure_details_markdown) - 18

### Common Issues
1. Unused imports (F401): 40+ occurrences
2. Line too long (E501): 100+ occurrences
3. Trailing whitespace (W291): Multiple occurrences
4. Blank line contains whitespace (W293): Multiple occurrences
5. Unused local variables (F841): Several occurrences

### Next Steps Priority
1. Refactor report.py execute method to reduce cognitive complexity
2. Clean up unused imports
3. Address line length issues
